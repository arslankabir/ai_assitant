Liberte walk and earn Detailed feature explaination and defination:
Liberte Walk & Earn:
A health and wellness app that rewards users for staying active.
Purpose: Project Liberte's Walk & Earn feature is designed to motivate users to adopt healthier lifestyles
while making a significant positive impact on the environment. By incentivizing walking as a daily habit,
we aim to engage a majority of our users in an activity that not only boosts their health but also
supports global sustainability efforts.
Reduced Carbon Footprint: Encouraging walking reduces reliance on vehicles, directly decreasing carbon
emissions. Widespread adoption of this habit can significantly lower urban air pollution.
Healthcare System Relief: Increased physical activity leads to better overall health, reducing the
prevalence of chronic diseases and consequently easing the pressure on healthcare facilities.
Lower Fuel Consumption: Less frequent use of vehicles for short distances dramatically cuts fuel
consumption, contributing further to environmental preservation.
Community Impact: Communities with higher rates of walking report stronger social bonds and higher
levels of happiness, creating a more vibrant and connected society.
Walk & Earn
In today's fast-paced digital world, individuals encounter several challenges that impact their physical
well-being and overall health:
Problems Syntex
Declining Physical Activity: Modern conveniences and technology have led to a drastic reduction in daily
physical activity, contributing to global health concerns.
Health Awareness: While there is a growing awareness of health and fitness, there remains a gap in
translating this awareness into consistent action.
Motivation for Exercise: Finding the motivation to exercise can be difficult, particularly when the
benefits are long-term and abstract rather than immediate and tangible.
Economic Barriers: Traditional wellness programs and fitness incentives are often tied to financial
capabilities, excluding those from lower economic backgrounds.
Technological Disconnect: Despite the proliferation of health apps and trackers, there is often a
disconnect between digital engagement and real-world activities.
Lack of Incentivization: Current wellness programs lack a system to reward day-to-day progress, making
sustained lifestyle changes less appealing.
Urban Lifestyle Constraints: City living often limits opportunities for natural, outdoor physical activities,
contributing to a more sedentary daily routine.
Screen Time Increase: With the rise of remote work and digital entertainment, screen time has surged,
often at the expense of physical activity.
Accessibility to Fitness: High costs of gym memberships and fitness classes can be a barrier, making
regular exercise less accessible to many.
Integration with Daily Routine: Incorporating exercise into a busy schedule can be challenging, leading to
a neglect of regular physical activity.
Lack of Community Support: Many individuals lack a community or group setting that encourages and
supports a commitment to physical health.
